# TASKS (8p)- calculate & print:
#0 Use alternative way of reading inputs - using library (0.5p)
#1 Perimeter & field of circles with given radius X for the first circle & Y for the second one. (1p)
#2 Find X & Y that satisfy: X is divisible by Y and both X & Y are even. (0.5p)
#3 Check if X is divisible by Y (do it in one line of code), print 'X is divisible by Y' or 'X is not divisible by Y'. (1p)
#Ad 3 Hint- use the "ternary operator" as we did calculating xIsEvenLog above.
#4 Add rounding for the above x/y operation. Round to 2 decimal points. Hint: look up in Google "python limiting number of decimals". (1p)
#5 Look at lab2-plot.py and create your own script which takes a number as an input and plots the same 3D wave but with different characteristics
# it's totally up to your imagination how do you want to amend the figure according to the input number (1p)
#6 Test your code. Check various edge cases. In other words: does your program (1, 3, 4 & 5)work for all input values?
# In case of task 4  do not forget to round to different amount of decimals and see if it still works.(3p)
